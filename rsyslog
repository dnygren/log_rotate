# Keep 28 logs instead of 4 weekly copies of the logs. This is likely to be 28
# daily copies, but if maxsize is exceeded, it could be 28 hourly copies if
# logrotate is called hourly.  This number of copies will give us coverage over
# 24 hours so if something is going wrong there is an opportunity to see a log
# file at the start, and also cover both sides of the planned two week
# power cycle.
